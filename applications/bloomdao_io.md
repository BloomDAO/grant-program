## Future Plans
Mission and long-term Vision
In modern age financial systems -the ability to achieve financial freedom- has been
available exclusively to those who had (some) wealth to begin with. More often than not,
one needed to be born to a successful family, have access to strong financial education,
and initial capital to play with. The haves vs the have-nots. getting from 0 to 1 in wealth
creation is a gigantic chasm extremely hard to overcome, meaning that you need to spend
most of your lives focusing on earning income. The introduction of crypto networks and
decentralized finance has offered countless improvements to the way financial systems
operates, often removing geographical barriers, middlemen and permission-seeking of
traditional systems. Unfortunately, financial inclusion has yet not been one of them.
Firstly, they require significant technical knowledge and expertise. Secondly, they require
a significant amount of time investment to monitor trends and markets on a regular basis.
Thirdly, high transaction fees. These prerequisites of expertise, time, and money make
access to DeFi a luxury available to a select few. We strongly believe that this vicious cycle
should cease to exist, and that anyone should be able to have control over their financial
future, no matter the country they live in, their economic status, their level of technical
expertise, or financial education. BloomDAO envisions a world where wealth creation is a
passive, automated process accessible to anyone with an internet connection without
heavy prerequisites, while strategies to create wealth are in the hands of the most
objectively talented individuals, distributed across the globe and correctly incentivized.
BloomDAO is a social conscience community completely decentralized from day one,
whose task is to govern the ecosystem of products designed to make this future possible.
Fully Financial Transparent Products accessible from small holders to whales.
Decentralised sustainable financial services not built-in opaque silos, all Information and
transactions are transparent and auditable to all participants.
