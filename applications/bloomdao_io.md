### Overview

Please provide the following:
- A brief description of the project. 
We as a decentralized autonomous organization are founding a traditional ETF on the blockchain. Our sustainable decentralized ETF allows investors aware of the environmental footprint of crypto to generate positive social and environmental impact alongside financial returns. Setup as a DAO to participate in the overall success with low fees and no fuss and provide full transparency simply by buying inBloom and fullBloom tokens. BloomDao bring impact investing to the DeFi space.
- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project within the VeChain Ecosystem.
Aligned with Vechain mission and solutions around Digital Carbon Footprint & Sustainability to drive enterprise adoption. BloomDAO is a solution for enterprises to hold and diversify into digital asset in line with their sustainability mission.   
- If relevant, an indication of how you will integrate tools and features (e.g., Sync2/Connex, fee delegation protocols, MTT, etc) to enhance your project. 

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about the project's expected final state.
Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):
- Mockups/designs of any UI components
Please see our product Demo https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bloomdao.io/team+intro.mp4
- API specifications of the core functionality
Specifications are in the GitHub repo.
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
Current Solidity and React.js. Evaluation blockchains with a lower energy foorprint and fees. 
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
Please see our Github page https://github.com/BloomDAO/
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
Please see MVP in our product demo https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bloomdao.io/team+intro.mp4

### Ecosystem Fit
Are there any other projects similar to yours? If so, how is your project different?
Indexed, Crypto20, Sci-fi Finance. Are all indexes but aren't setup as a DAO, do impact investing, have cross chain functionality, is a layer 2 solution, have NFTs integrated. Showing high tracking errors and low liquididty.

### Example Roadmap for a dApp Application

dApp application will follow the development roadmap.  


#### Overview

Please see budget plan https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bloomdao.io/Budgetplan.pdf

#### Milestone 1 — Smart Contract & Backend

0-a: License: GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 
0-b: Documentation: We will provide documentation of the code (open-source GitHub repository), create a blog with a tutorial on a platform such as medium. We will also prepare a tutorial on the code, separate from the blog/article.  
0-c: Testing: We will employ best software engineering practices and implement test-driven code development with a testing coverage of 90%. The documentation will also provide clear instructions on how to run the tests. 
0-d: Continuous research on assets: We will continuously research, assess and re-evaluate the assets that are to be included in the DAO, according to multiple criteria. 

1- inBloom Dapp launch: Development and connection to vetted blockchains (that fulfill a set of sustainability criteria): 
2. Personal dashboard: Develop the frontend of the personal dashboard and all functionalities it will support
3. Integrate different crypto exchanges: make sure the Dapp supports various (at first only crypto) exchanges
4. Implement zero slippage: ensure the Dapp can execute limit orders, not only market orders to prevent slippage

#### Milestone 2  —  Frontend

1. fullBloom Dapp launch
2. Automated rebalancing strategies: implement automated rebalancing strategies (baseline and others, in accordance to research)
3. NFT integration and fiat gateway integration
4. Multiple wallets integration: allow for multiple wallets that a user may hold
5. Data lake construction: to enable analysis and open door to data science and AI solutions (especially in the evaluation of the assets)
6. Aragon DAO integration and smart contract dev
7. Cross- and side blockchain development: tbd which blockchains precisely 

#### Community engagement

Milestone December 2022: Full DAO launch

## Future Plans
Mission and long-term Vision
In modern age financial systems -the ability to achieve financial freedom- has been
available exclusively to those who had (some) wealth to begin with. More often than not,
one needed to be born to a successful family, have access to strong financial education,
and initial capital to play with. The haves vs the have-nots. getting from 0 to 1 in wealth
creation is a gigantic chasm extremely hard to overcome, meaning that you need to spend
most of your lives focusing on earning income. The introduction of crypto networks and
decentralized finance has offered countless improvements to the way financial systems
operates, often removing geographical barriers, middlemen and permission-seeking of
traditional systems. Unfortunately, financial inclusion has yet not been one of them.
Firstly, they require significant technical knowledge and expertise. Secondly, they require
a significant amount of time investment to monitor trends and markets on a regular basis.
Thirdly, high transaction fees. These prerequisites of expertise, time, and money make
access to DeFi a luxury available to a select few. We strongly believe that this vicious cycle
should cease to exist, and that anyone should be able to have control over their financial
future, no matter the country they live in, their economic status, their level of technical
expertise, or financial education. BloomDAO envisions a world where wealth creation is a
passive, automated process accessible to anyone with an internet connection without
heavy prerequisites, while strategies to create wealth are in the hands of the most
objectively talented individuals, distributed across the globe and correctly incentivized.
BloomDAO is a social conscience community completely decentralized from day one,
whose task is to govern the ecosystem of products designed to make this future possible.
Fully Financial Transparent Products accessible from small holders to whales.
Decentralised sustainable financial services not built-in opaque silos, all Information and
transactions are transparent and auditable to all participants.
